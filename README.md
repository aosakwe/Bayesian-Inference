# For exam

-   likelihood approximations

-   alternate distributions

-   sampling procedures and purposes

## Premise

This project allows me to implement different Bayesian modelling techniques I have seen through class and my own research. In addition, I hope it serves as educational material for others. I have found that the best way to learn is through practice, and so this project is expected to help me master the material I need to undertake my research projects.

The notes and examples I share will be heavily based on work I found on the following pages:

### Links to Notebooks

Links to the different notebooks I make will be stored here:

### TODO

1.  Add citations to each topic
2.  Add section on Jeffreys Prior

## Missing topics

-   Dirichlet Processes
-   Variational Inference
