## Premise

This project allows me to implement different Bayesian modelling techniques I have seen through class and my own research. In addition, I hope it serves as educational material for others. I have found that the best way to learn is through practice, and so this project is expected to help me master the material I need to undertake my research projects.

The projects and notes I take will be heavily based on work I found on the following pages:
