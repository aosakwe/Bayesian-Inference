We previously looked at how the prior can influence the posterior distribution when few observations are made. To this end, as $n$ increases, we expect the **likelihood** to play a crucial role in defining the posterior. This can be highlighted by expression the posterior on a log scale:

$$
log\pi_n(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^nlogf_Y(y_i;\theta) + log\pi_0(\theta) + C
$$

where the log-prior is constant with respect to $\theta$ whereas the influence of the log-likelihood will grow with an increasing sample size. This makes it imperative to explore the properties of the likelihood as $n$ increases.
